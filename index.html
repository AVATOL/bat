<p>Welcome to the AVATOL Computer Vision Project! This project is developed by computer vision group of Oregon State University, lead by Dr. <a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/%7Esinisa/">Sinisa Todorovic</a>. </p>

<p>This code is used for building the part based model for localizing parts in a bat skull image. The code is built based on the <a href="https://github.com/wg-perception/PartsBasedDetector">PartsBasedDetector</a> project and Yi Yang's code for [1]. Within the context of AVATOL project, the parts are skull parts, e.g. teeth and nasal. This version focuses on localizing characters, i.e. presence or absense. Sequential characters recognition could be further developed based on the predicted locations of parts in the image.</p>

<a name="how-to-use-the-code" class="anchor" href="#how-to-use-the-code"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to use the code</h3>

<p>The system basically includes 2 main conponents: training and testing. Please follow the steps below to learn the models for each species. NOTE that current code is mainly used for localization, so the size of parts are the same in the model. </p>

<ul>
<li>Run compile.m to compile the required mex files. NOTE that mex has to be set up first.</li>
<li>Annotate your training data. A simple utility util/annotateParts.m is provided. User need to click on the center of each tooth. </li>
<li>Run demo.m (for Artibeus) to see how to train and test with the part based model. The data of species Artibeus is supplied.</li>
</ul><h3>
